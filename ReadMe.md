# Special Purpose Vehicle Web Application

## Introduction

A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is a legal business entity where assets are placed and
the payments from assets (interest and principle) are distributed based on the waterfall. 
A waterfall is prioritization of investors with a declared interest rate. The highest priority
investor has the most protection with the lowest interest rate. 

For example, a bank can buy an SPV of credit card accounts as a portfolio where interest 
payments and the principles is disbursed to the investors at designated times. 

Just like a regular business the portfolio has live accounts that must be maintained to ensure timely 
payment of interest and principle. Financial analysis must be done quarterly by the organization and ensure
that it fits within the internal committee parameters.

## Inspiration

The reporting is done by the originator through the Excel sheets. These Excel sheets are used to update 
the portfolio holder's Excel sheet to conduct analysis. This process is inefficient and tedious because the
Excel sheets are unstructured and contain charts. This makes parsing extremely difficult. In addition, the location
of these Excel sheets may be lost within a large organization and extremely difficult to update.
